# CMPM 121 D1 Project

This is the starting point for your CMPM 121 D1 project. The goal of this project is to create a simple web application using TypeScript, Vite, and modern web development practices. Students should make sure to add Author: Joseph Coulson. Class: CMPM-121. First project of the quarter, this is a "cookie clicker" clone that is built using typescript and vite. INSPIRATION CREDIT: the idea for a colored background came from <https://thatguyiain.github.io/cmpm-121-incremental-game/> they made a corn clicker game that has a nice yellow background. Inpiration for the themed header, button layout, and counter styling choices came from <https://mgembree.github.io/cmpm-121-f25-mattembree/> they also made a frog clicker game and I liked the way they layed out their UI.
